            <p>Striking both palms down upon the ground, a web of flame crackles out around the caster and five streaks of fire rapidly snake along the ground toward up to five enemies the caster can see within a range of 60 feet, leaping towards their target and exploding into a column of flame upon reaching them. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">Alternatively, all five streaks of fire can instead converge toward a single target, dealing 12d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">The fire can travel over obstacles up to 5 feet high, and ignites flammable objects along its path that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
