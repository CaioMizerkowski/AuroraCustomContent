		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Native to the world of Krynn, Kender are diminutive Humanoids that look like humans with pointed ears and diverse appearances. Kender have a supernatural curiosity that drives them on to adventures big and small. This curiosity is said to be connected to the whimsical magic of the Feywild, that some believe kender have a high affinity for. Due to their curiosity, many kender have found themselves falling through gates and portals to other planes and worlds.</p>
			<p class="flavor">Unknown to most mortals, a magical phenomenon surrounds a kender. Spurred by their curiosity and love for trinkets, curios, and keepsakes, a kender’s pouches or pockets will be magically filled with these objects. No one knows where these objects come from, not even the kender. This has led many kender to be mislabeled as thieves when they fish these items out of their pockets.</p>

			<p>On many worlds, the moon is a revered celestial body with magical properties. On Krynn, the gods of magic are associated with the world's three moons. On the world of Toril, the god Selûne uses the light of the moon to battle darkness. On Eberron, scholars of the Draconic Prophecy decipher ancient secrets from the waxing and waning of that world's twelve moons. </p>

Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spells. Consult the Manifestations of Lunar Magic table, then choose or randomly determine how your connection to the moon manifests while you cast your sorcerer spells.</p>

			<description>
				<p>You have trained to be a valorous warrior known as a Knight of Solamnia. Strict rules guide your every action, and you work to uphold them as you strive to defend the weak and oppose all forms of evil. Your honor is as important to you as your life.</p>
				<p class="indent">Any class or subclass that has martial prowess can be a good fit in the Knights of Solamnia. Fighters and paladins make up the bulk of the knighthood’s forces. Clerics (often with the War domain) can also be found among the knights' ranks. For a more unusual take on a Knight of Solamnia character, consider playing a bard of the College of Valor (or the College of Swords from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) or a barbarian devoted to the ideals of the nature god Habbakuk (perhaps adopting the Path of the Zealot from Xanathar’s Guide to Everything).</p>

			<description>
				<p>Your talent for magic came to the attention of the Mages of High Sorcerery, an organization of spellcasters that study magic and prevent its misuse. You've trained among the Mages, but whether or not you'll face the dangerous tests required to become a true member of the group remains to be determined. your passion for studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of the organization's three ordres: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the balance-pursuing Order of the Red Robes, or the ruthless Order of the Black Robes.</p>
				<p class="indent">In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of High Sorcerery as the Wizards of High Sorcerery. The organization accepts more than wizards, though, with bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and other sepllcasters included among their ranks.</p>
				<p class="indent">Mages of High Sorcerery are typically bards, wizards, or warlocks and might have any subclass. Spellcasters who gain their magic through devotion or who possess innate magic are less likely to be welcomed among the traditionalist mages. Nevertheless, the Mages of High Sorcerery are shrewd, and they rarely let unique opportunities or individuals pass them by. Even members of martial classes who train in magic might find a rare place among the group's three orders.</p>

			<prerequisite>4th Level, Squire of Solamnia feat</prerequisite>
			<requirements>ID_WOTC_UA_HOK_FEAT_SQUIRE_OF_SOLAMNIA,[level:4]</requirements>
			<description>
				<p>You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Sword, a group devoted to heroism and courage. Bravery steels your spirit, granting you these benefits:</p>
				<p class="indent"><em>Disciplined Spirit.</em>You gain proficiency in Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws (your choice when you take this feat).</p>
				<p class="indent"><em>Willpower.</em> Immediately after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can expend a Hit Die. The saving throw increases by an amount equal to a roll of that Hit Die, potentially turning a failure into a success. Once you turn a failed saving throw into a successful one using this feat, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
				<p>Knights of Solamnia are only ever members of one of their organization's orders. In the course of their training, most knights begin as members of the Knights of the Crown and then move on to join other orders. Whether a character follows this path or another, they retain what they learned as a member of an order even if they join another. Characters can change what knightly order they're a part of, but they always have access to any Knight of Solamnia feats they've acquired.</p>
