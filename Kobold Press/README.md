<h1>Vault of Magic</h2>
Throughout the Vault of Magic there are unique items and categories. Certain consumables have special rules.

<h2>Bezoars</h2>
A bezoar is a solid mass of indigestible material that accumulates in a creature’s digestive tract. A bezoar looks and feels like a small stone. Any creature can expel a bezoar, but bezoars from creatures with magical origins or with a natural inclination for magic have unique, magical properties when consumed by another creature. 

To gain the benefits of a bezoar, you must swallow it whole. When you swallow a bezoar, your hit point maximum is reduced by 2d4, and the bezoar remains in your stomach for a number of days equal to that amount. At the end of the duration, you automatically regurgitate the used-up bezoar, take 2d4 acid damage from the process of expelling the bezoar, and your hit point maximum returns to normal. A used-up bezoar is nonmagical and crumbles to dust within minutes. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check can force you to regurgitate the bezoar early. A bezoar that has been regurgitated before the end of its duration recharges and becomes fully functional again after 24 hours have passed, provided it remains outside of a creature’s body this entire time. 

You can gain the benefits of only one bezoar at a time, and while a bezoar sits in your stomach, you can’t gain any benefit from other edible magic items, such as potions. Although the bezoar is uncomfortable, it doesn’t impact your ability to eat or drink, but it does prevent you from gaining any special benefits from consuming magical foodstuffs, such as those produced by the goodberry and heroes’ feasts spells or fantastical foods and beverages (described later in this section). 

Owlbear Curses. Owlbears are not picky eaters and wind up devouring all sorts of nastiness: carrion, furry creatures, magical plants, fey river stones, feathery things, nut shells, and magic-infused bone. As such, bezoars from owlbears have a 50 percent chance of being cursed. You can’t remove a cursed bezoar before its full duration (when you regurgitate it as normal) unless you are first targeted by a remove curse spell. However, if the bezoar is not removed before your next short or long rest after the spell’s casting, the curse returns. The curse ends automatically once the bezoar is regurgitated. 

<h2>Specialty Food & Drink</h2>
Fantastical foods and beverages are unique types of consumable magic items. They look, feel, smell, and taste like nonmagical food or beverages, but fantastical food and beverages never spoil. 

To gain the benefits from a fantastical food or beverage, you must spend at least 1 minute consuming it. If you eat a fantastical food or beverage as part of a short rest and you expend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points, you double the number of hit points each Hit Die restores. Each type of fantastical food or beverage also grants benefits, which you gain after consuming the food or beverage or at the end of the short rest where the food or beverage was consumed (your choice). You can gain the benefits from only one type of fantastical food or beverage at a time. 

<h2>Cooking Fantastical Foods and Beverages.</h2> 
Fantastical foods and beverages provide temporary benefits and work much like potions or spell scrolls—in fact, the fantastical foods and beverages listed here are categorized as potions because of this. To cook up a fantastical food or beverage during downtime, the character needs the recipe. Otherwise, treat cooking a fantastical food or beverage no differently than brewing a potion or scribing a spell scroll.  

<h2>Spirit Honey</h2>
Spirit honey is the natural honey made by nonmagical bees that harvest and use the nectar of poisonous or magical plants. The essences of these plants are concentrated by the bees into a powerful yet mind bending treat. Many alchemists and hedge witches feel the rewards of spirit honey outweigh the risks, and their regular consumption of the magical honey often contributes to stories of “mad” alchemists or “quirky” witches. 

To gain the benefits from spirit honey, you must consume it. When you eat spirit honey, you gain its benefits and a long-term madness for 1d10 x 10 hours. If you suffer the madness of the spirit honey for the full duration, you gain insight into some aspect of the universe. If your madness is cured before the end of the duration, you lose all benefits of the spirit honey, and you don’t gain the insight. The calm emotions spell can temporarily suppress the madness caused by the spirit honey for the duration of the spell, but you also lose the benefits of the spirit honey for that same duration. The use of this spell doesn’t negatively impact you receiving insight at the end of the spirit honey’s duration.
