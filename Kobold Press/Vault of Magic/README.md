<h2>ASSASSIN'S CHAIN</h2>
This fine chain shirt is fashioned from thousands of tiny, interlocking rings of a mysterious black metal. The chain makes virtually no noise when worn. 
Gildreth was a killer. He killed for money; he killed for pleasure. In the end, he killed only for revenge.Gildreth had earned many enemies in his long career; chief among them were the Black Cabal. On a moonless night, while Gildreth was away, members of the Cabal infiltrated his home and murdered his family. When Gildreth returned and discovered his slain family, he vowed he would not rest until every last member of the Cabal was dead by his own hand.One by one, Gildreth tracked down and assassinated the Cabal. He was relentless and single-minded, allowing nothing to stand in his way. 
Not even his death. As Gildreth was infiltrating the fortress of the Cabal’s leader, he felt a sharp and sudden pain—a thin sword blade was protruding from his chest! Blood poured from the wicked wound and down his chain shirt. Gildreth gasped, his eyes grew dim, and he fell lifelessly to the floor.

Then Gildreth’s eyes snapped opened. He felt his life surging back into his body! The tiny chain rings of his armor had turned a deep black and showed no sign of the deadly wound. He understood immediately—not even Death itself would stop him!In time, the last of the Black Cabal lay dying at Gildreth’s feet. At that moment, Gildreth suddenly felt his own life slipping away, and he understood at last. Death had allowed him to live only long enough to complete his vendetta. 
The fate of Gildreth’s strange chain shirt is unknown. Perhaps it found its way to another soul seeking vengeance…

<h2>BATTLECASTER'S ARMOR</h2>
This fine mithral breastplate is light and exquisitely made. 
It is decorated with delicate arcane glyphs and symbols which glow with a soft, blue light. 
Long ago, the legendary warrior-mage known as Gax walked the land. Gax, later known to history as Gax the Great, was a mysterious figure renowned for his uncanny ability to weave together martial and magical combat in unique and powerful ways. An unparalleled master at crafting magic arms and armor, Gax is known for a number of fantastic, magical items. He is said to have created his first great item of magic when he was still a young apprentice. At that time, his master was an old wizard who mercilessly drilled the fundamentals of magic into the young apprentice’s mind. The studious old wizard also derisively dismissed Gax's ideas for combining magic and battle and openly berated Gax for his love of swordplay, weaponry, and armor.

Determined to prove that his theories were possible (and, truth be told, equally determined to spite his master), Gax apprenticed himself at the same time to a renowned weapon smith and armorer in a nearby town. The youth quickly proved as skilled at metalcraft as he was at magic. Young Gax spent his days in magical study and his nights working in the smith's forge, crafting an exquisite breastplate of the finest mithral. He imbued the breastplate’s delicate glyphs and symbols with powerful protective magic far beyond the ability of magic-wielders many years his senior.

When the breastplate was finally completed, Gax proudly showed it to his mentor. The smith was so impressed that he coveted it for himself, and he demanded that Gax give the breastplate to him. When Gax refused, the smith attempted to take it by force. At the end of a quick but violent scuffle, the smith lay dead near the very anvil on which Gax had finished his wondrous breastplate. Shocked and terrified, the boy fled, running to the small stone building where the old wizard lived. Hoping the wizard would be understanding about what happened and suitably impressed with Gax's magical breastplate, the boy breathlessly recounted recent events.

The old wizard was neither understanding nor impressed. He coldly chided Gax for wasting his time on a “trinket” and rebuked Gax for taking a life over“nothing more than a worthless piece of pretty metal.” Furious and defeated, Gax shouted profanities at his master before running off into the woods.Gax decided that he would make his way in the world on his own terms. He would learn everything he could about magic and combat, he would excel in both, and he would do whatever it took to fuse the two into what would eventually become known as the style of the battlecaster.From that day on, until the day he drew his final breath, Gax was never without his beloved battlecaster's armor.

<h2>BLOOD MOON ORB</h2>
This strange orb is the size of a human’s head, and appears to be crafted from a single piece of glass. No seam or opening is visible, yet the orb is filled with a thick red liquid, which swirls slowly within.

Most female serpentine lamia (see Creature Codex) take part in the Revelry, part sacred ceremony and part frenzied celebration, which occurs on nights of the full moon. Those who partake in these secretive mysteries believe they are possessed and empowered by the mystical power of the very moon itself. Outsiders do not generally learn details of what transpires during these moonlit ceremonies. Although no two Revelries are identical, there are elements in every ceremony which never change. Celebrants participate in chaotic dancing, hypnotic swaying, and frenzied distortions of their serpentine bodies as if seized with madness. Snakes are also typically involved in the Revelry, with participants often wearing them around their bodies or otherwise handling them in various symbolic and proscribed manners. 

The rite culminates in an ecstatic, mystical fervor and extreme loss of inhibition known as Shiv’ash (literally, “the madness and ecstasy of the moon”). In this state, the lamia lose all self-control. They shout excitedly, shrieking out prophecies, and engage in all manner of debauchery. 

The Night of the Blood Moon occurs once per year. It is the most sacred of all Revelries—a time when alliances are sealed, blood sacrifices are made, wars are ended, and new matriarchs are chosen. It is during a Night of the Blood Moon long ago that a powerful lamia cult created the blood moon orb.Little is known about the blood moon orb, save that it contains blood drops from the one hundred sacrifices made that night. It is said the lamia females wished to capture the mystical spirit of the moon itself in theblood moon orb, and some believe they did exactly that.

<h2>BLOOD SPIKE ARMOR</h2>
This ancient plate armor is crafted from a strange black metal. Vicious spikes protrude from the shoulders and breastplate. Hideous, demonic faces are etched into the black metal.

Gregor the Red was a legendary warrior with a thirst for blood. On one occasion, Gregor was hired to retrieve a golden cup from an ancient tomb. After many dangerous encounters, Gregor at last found the golden cup in the lowest bowels of the tomb. As he reached for the cup, he noticed a suit of ancient armor piled in a corner. Gregor was mesmerized by the frightening armor. He would take the golden cup back to his employer, but he would claim the magnificent armor for himself!

Once back at his base, Gregor set about the long and difficult task of restoring and repairing the armor. He hired the best armorers and weaponsmiths to ensure the armor was brought back to all its former glory. Of course, he also could not resist having his smiths add new detailing to the armor to be sure everyone knew it was his and his alone.

Gregor wore his terrifying spiked armor on every mission and campaign from that day on. He even mastered close-combat techniques that helped him utilize the armor spikes. Gregor derived a perverse pleasure from driving the spikes into his enemies and watching the blood drip onto his armor. Because of this, Gregor named his beloved plate blood spike armor. Gregor is said to have lost his life to a powerful undead being in some far-away crypt. As far as anyone knows, his remains and armor could still be there…

<h2>BRACERS OF GANIS’BRIEL</h2>
These metal bracers lined with soft leather are etched with beautifully intricate elven patterns and designs. There are countless tales about the various companions who travelled with the legendary Gax the Great. One of the more popular is the half elf Ganis’briel. One of Gax’s closest and most trusted friends, Ganis’briel was often by his side. Ganis’briel’s skills as an archer were almost as famous as Gax’s skills with a blade. When fighting alongside Gax against a terrible giant, however, even Ganis’briel’s incredible skills as an archer were not enough to defeat the giant. He and Gax barely escaped with their lives.

To even the odds, Gax crafted a magical set of bracers that enhanced Ganis’briel’s already formidable skill with the bow. As he strapped them to his forearms, Ganis’briel could feel the magic of all elfkind flow into him.

The second battle with the giant went quite differently than the first. Ganis’briel’s arrows found their mark time and time again, until at last, the giant was dead! Ganis’briel eventually passed his magical bracers on to his daughter, who wore them proudly for many decades. The bracers became treasured heirlooms and were passed from generation to generation of Ganis’briel’s descendants until they were eventually lost to history.

<h2>CAILEBRYN</h2>
This razor-sharp longsword is clearly of outstanding craftsmanship. The blade is faintly etched with numerous arcane runes and symbols.

Cailebryn is considered one of the legendary warrior mage Gax’s greatest achievements. Sadly, it was borne from his greatest sorrow. 

The love of Gax’s life was his elven wife, Alyria. When Alyria was slain in a terrible demon raid, Gax was heartbroken and fell into a deep despair. His despair, however, soon gave way to rage and a righteous sense of purpose. Gax channeled his profound sorrow and rage into forging a magnificent blade, which he honed to a preternatural sharpness. The famed smith gently laid seven golden strands of his beloved wife’s hair upon the newly forged blade and wove powerful magic into it. Gax named his new sword Cailebryn, which means “the sharpest cut” in Elvish. 

Gax the Great wielded Cailebryn for the rest of his days, and with every demon he destroyed, he cried out “for Alyria!”

<h2>CHAMPION’S PLATE</h2>
This exquisitely crafted, golden plate armor has a stylized horse’s head emblazoned on the breastplate.Every year, a much-beloved Queen held a great jousting tournament. Knights from across the land came to participate, for the prize was wondrous indeed—the Queen would grant the winner any boon if it was in her power to do so.

On the tenth anniversary of the Queen’s Tourney, a great celebration was held. The jousts were even more impressive than in years past. More knights than ever before participated, and the events were nothing short of spectacular. One mysterious knight was victorious in every event. He was the most accomplished horseman the people had ever seen; his skill with lance and sword was unmatched; his chivalrous and honorable continence were unparalleled. The crowd cheered as the knight strode forward and knelt before the Queen’s royal box, his head bowed. When the Queen asked what boon he wished as a reward, the humble knight asked simply to become her champion to keep her safe so that the kingdom could continue to prosper under her just rule.And so, the young knight became the Queen’s Champion, swearing an oath to protect her with his very life.

After decades of exemplary service as the Queen’s Champion, the brave knight lost the battle with the only opponent capable of defeating him—time. The old knight was buried with his armor in the royal crypt. It is said that just before the Champion’s body was sealed within the stone sarcophagus, the old Queen, who had never married, wept openly, for she had grown to love the knight deeply. Her tears fell upon the knight’s armor, and in that moment, so the story goes, the spirit of the old knight knew at last that his Queen truly loved him as he had loved her.

<h2>FIRE SHIELD OF RATHUME</h2>
This round, wooden shield is rimmed in iron. The wood is blackened as if burned by a terrible flame, yet the wood is as strong as steel. 

The ancient red dragon Abraxys the Red dwelt within a volcano in a ring of hills. The vile wyrm delighted in erupting from the volcano to breathe destruction and death on the people of the near-by towns.For generations, the oppressed people did what they could to combat the dragon, yet Abraxys’s reign of terror continued.

Finally, a young warrior named Rathume pledged to rid the land of the cruel dragon. The townsfolk laughed—she was young and inexperienced. How could she hope to defeat such a monster? Rathume was undeterred. What she lacked in experience, she made up for in courage. What she lacked in battle prowess, she made up for in faith.

The very next dawn, when Abraxys emerged from the volcano and swooped toward the town, the gates opened and Rathume emerged, holding a spear and clutching a large, wooden shield. The ancient dragon landed and grinned maliciously at the sight of the small human, standing alone in the grass. Abraxys roared with laughter as the girl strode confidently toward the mighty beast, quickly closing the distance between them.

The great dragon drew back and prepared to incinerate the brash young woman. Suddenly, Rathume raised her shield and rushed forward. The startled dragon breathed forth gouts of flame, engulfing Rathume, yet she continued to rush forward, unaffected by the fire! 

Rathume plunged her spear into the dragon’s belly and there was a sudden, fiery blast which consumed them both. Only Rathume’s shield remained. It was blackened by the flames, yet otherwise unscathed. Miraculously, the powerful magic of the dragon and the heroic fire in Rathume’s heart had become somehow fused with the shield.
Many generations of brave warriors have carried the fire shield of Rathume from then on, striving always to live up to the legend of the brave Rathume.

<h2>FOULTON DOOR</h2>
Decades ago, long before I possessed the scholarly renown I currently enjoy, my children came to dinner chattering and brim-full of faerie stories from their governess. From soup to cheese, they told tales of a hero possessed of a “Folding Door” that fit in his pocket. When “unfolded” to full size it could be set anywhere (a stone wall, a tree, a waterfall) and opened to anywhere in the wide world, whisking the hero and her companions away from trouble in a trice. 

Too young to separate fact from fiction, yet old enough to recognize the prowess of their father, they asked me to craft them such a door. I explained that an object able to produce instant, multiple-location, inter-planar conjuration was impossible. 

To ease the sting of their disappointment, I explained that their story, while pure nonsense, was still interesting from an etymological standpoint. Centuries ago, a wizard named Foulton Konig was famed for creating magical doors. Sadly, specific details are lacking as his labs, libraries, and notes were lost when his mansion was destroyed in a catastrophically thorough, but historically non-specific way.  

My children were fascinated to hear my theory that metaplasmic drift in the language (doubtless working in concert with poor education and rustic accents) eventually led a genuine product of magical artifice (a door made by Foulton) to eventually enter folklore as a “Folding Door.” 

This was my first brush with my eventual life’s work and passion: my endless quest to separate the history of artifice from stories of the artificial. As such, I feel an odd gratitude toward their old governess, and occasionally feel a bit of remorse about ending her employment over the incident. Still, there are genuine wonders aplenty in the world without cluttering the minds of the young with nonsense. 

Mine is an endless struggle to separate fact from fancy, as shown by events of three months ago. Out conducting research, (while cunningly disguised to mix among the common folk) a seemingly reputable vendor of magical curiosities offered to sell me “a fragment of a Foulton Door.” (Note Fig 1. a splinter of wood, slightly longer than a handspan across.) Destroyed long ago, so powerful were the original doors that if even a small piece such as this were incorporated into an existing door, it would become imbued with the power of a magic portal. A quick check revealed the shard of wood did, in fact, possess a powerful, unfamiliar dweomer.

With dubious curiosity, I bought it, returned to my lab, and followed their instructions. My tools and talents are not designed for anything so base as carpentry, but in the pursuit of truth I dutifully paid several hours of my precious time, a set of skinned knuckles, and one badly hammered thumb to patch the small piece of wood into one of the secondary pantry’s doors. 

I then inserted the key to my winter lodgings, concentrated, and opened the door as the merchant had instructed me. Nothing happened, of course, and when I checked, the wood no longer showed any traces of magic. 

When I returned to the merchant to demand both an ethical and economic accounting, he had the audacity to imply it was my own fault, and refused to admit his obvious charlatanry or refund the twenty gold I had spent. While I regularly spend much greater sums in the course of my research, I nevertheless engaged the constabulary to bring the fellow into custody, as behavior such as this does nothing but defraud the simple-minded and tarnish the reputation of those engaging in legitimate arcane pursuits….

<h2>GAUNTLETS OF THE ARCANE FIST</h2>
These golden gauntlets are covered with arcane, spiral symbols of pure silver. 

Riggslet (‘Riggs’, for short) was a halfling wizard who traveled with the legendary Gax the Great for a time. The thing Riggs most hated about himself was his stature. Despite his considerable skill with magic, the little halfling’s most profound wish was that he had been born big, strong, and physically powerful. Gax always told his friend that true strength comes from within, but Riggs continued to lament his physical weakness and size. Finally, when he could bear his friend’s complaints no longer, Gax gave Riggs a wonderful gift—a pair of magnificent, enchanted gauntlets. When wearing the gauntlets, Riggs gained great strength and found his magic enhanced in wondrous ways. In time, Gax and Riggs came to a small village near a high mountain pass. The people there welcomed the strangers, who happily remained in the village for many weeks. 

Then, the giants attacked. Gax and Riggs battled the giants and did everything they could to defend the village. Riggs used the power of his gauntlets to great effect, but in the end, he found it was his bravery and willingness to give his life to protect the villagers that truly won the day. Gax had been right—Riggs’s true strength had indeed been inside him all along.

From then on, Riggs was known as Riggslet Giantsbane. Many years later, the brave halfling returned to the mountain village and retired, content to live out his days among the people he had protected years earlier. Riggs never had children, but he did take on an apprentice, a small girl with a gift for magic. It is believed that Riggs bestowed his magical gauntlets to his student on his deathbed, though the girl remained silent on the subject. She left the village a few days after her mentor’s death to make her mark on the world. If she had Riggs’s gauntlets of the arcane fist with her when she left, none can say.

<h2>GOLDEN GRIFFON SHIELD</h2>
This kite shield has the image of a bronze griffon etched and embossed on its surface. The griffon glows with a soft, amber light. 

Bronwyn was a ranger renowned for his pure heart, generous nature, and courageous defense of the natural world. His closest companion was his mount, a highly intelligent and fiercely loyal griffon with golden feathers. 

One fateful autumn day, wyverns attacked Bronwyn and his griffon while the pair flew high above a barren plain. During the battle, Bronwyn’s griffon suffered several poisonous stings. Weakened, the animal was unable to remain aloft. Bronwyn and the griffon plummeted to the rocky ground far below.In a final, heroic act, the griffon twisted in midair so its body took the brunt of the impact. Although badly injured, Bronwyn survived the fall. His brave griffon did not. Wracked with grief and guilt, the ranger plucked a single golden feather from the dead griffon then buried his loyal mount there among the rocks where it died.

Bronwyn carried that golden feather with him for many months. Eventually, he had a magical shield crafted to honor his fallen friend. Bronwyn watched as the expert craftsman’s hammer fell repeatedly on the new shield, giving it shape and form. Just as the last hammer blow fell, Brownwyn tossed the feather onto the shield. The plumage vanished as the craftsman’s hammer struck, as if the golden feather had somehow fused with the metal. At that moment, the sleek image of a griffon appeared on the shield’s surface, glowing with a soft, amber light.Bronwyn named the shield Golden Griffon. It was this shield he bore when he hunted and killed the wyverns that had slain his companion. Unfortunately, the fate of the shield is not known today.

<h2>GRINNING SKULL</h2>
This strange white skull is carved from a single piece of alabaster and is as large as a human head. Strange sigils and magical symbols are etched into the skull’s forehead. One of the first white necromancers, Althaghast, espoused true necromancy—the enlightened understanding of the mysterious connection between life, death, and unlife. His deep and profound understanding of life’s eternal cycle—the necromantic triad—made him a potent healer as well as a powerful spellcaster.

Althaghast dwelled in a hilltop tower within a mist-shrouded realm suddenly infested with undead. The people lived in fear, for the undead ranks were inexplicably growing unchecked.

At last, Althaghast knew he had to restore the balance. He carved a gleaming skull from solid alabaster, and for many weeks worked his most powerful magic upon it.
The white necromancer used his strange skull to great effect, rooting out nests of vampires, eventually dragging the screaming vampire lord into the purifying light of the sun. He defeated a powerful spectre haunting a lonely road, and he even put a terrible lich to rest.

When the balance between life, death, and unlife had at last been restored, Althaghast returned to the solitude of his tower. One evening, just after sunset, a beautiful woman came to speak with him. She asked about his magical alabaster skull, which he admitted was secured elsewhere in the tower.

It was then that he noticed, for the first time, her deathly pale complexion. And her fangs.Althaghast no longer protects the land. Rumors persist that his grinning skull lies in some forgotten crypt, a trophy for the vampire queen who ended the foolish white necromancer’s life.

<h2>HEALER’S HAND AMULET</h2>
This simple amulet has the raised image of an open hand within a circle upon it. The hand glows ever so slightly with a soft, golden light. 

Jhana the healer was a study in contrast. She had the gift of powerful divine healing and unmatched abilities in natural healing. Jhana was also a warrior, skilled with weapons and trained in the art of war. While there are many tales of Jhana efficiently dispatching enemies, even more tell of her tireless efforts to heal those that were in need, all in the name of the deity of life and healing.

On the eve of what was to be a terrible battle, Jhana was visited in dream by the voice of her deity. In the dream, she was told to heal as many of the wounded as possible in the coming battle, regardless of their allegiance. Jhana awoke instantly, her body bathed in sweat. Around her neck was a strange, yet wonderous amulet. Jhana recognized it at once as the divine hand of her deity!

The ensuing battle was one of the most brutal in history. When it was over, Jhana stood amid the sea of bodies and listened to the cries of the wounded. The magnitude of death was overwhelming. Bloodied and exhausted, Jhana moved among the bodies, healing every soul she could. As she went about her divinely appointed task, the hand upon her amulet glowed brightly. Jhana could feel her deity within her as the healing magic flowed through her hands.From that day forward, Jhana dedicated herself entirely to her deity. Although she continued to carry weapons, she used them only as a last resort. She spent the remainder of her days helping others and spreading messages of life and healing.Jhana’s amulet is thought to be buried with her, though none know the location of her marble tomb.
