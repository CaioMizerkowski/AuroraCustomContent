<!-- Blue Rose Tea -->
    <element name="Blue Rose Tea" type="Magic Item" source="Vault of Magic" id="ID_KBP_VOM_MAGIC_ITEM_BLUE_ROSE_TEA">
        <description>
            <p>The petals of the blue rose can be brewed into a tea. When you consume a dose of this tea, you get a glimpse into the future. This effect works like the divination spell, except the answer comes to you in visions rather than from a deity or its servants, and you can ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 14 days.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can render a dose of blue rose (see page 113) into three doses of blue rose tea with a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check. If you succeed by 5 or more on the check, you make four doses of tea instead. On a failed check, you make only one dose of tea.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Blue Rose Addiction.</i></b> Consuming blue rose tea doesn’t cause addiction like its more potent counterpart. However, if you are addicted to blue rose, consuming one dose of this tea removes one level of exhaustion and halts the effects of the addiction for 24 hours. This effect can’t reduce your exhaustion level below 1 and can’t end the addiction.</p>

If you were not at least 60 years old, you awaken in the body of a newborn. You retain all your knowledge in any case.</p>

            <p>The aboleth’s powerful magic permeates the food, giving it an almost spicy aftertaste. When you consume this food, you can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 60 feet of you, you can breathe underwater, and you have immunity to the charmed condition for 1 hour. In addition, once before the duration ends, you can use an action to charm a creature you can see within 60 feet of you for the remaining duration. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or it is charmed by you. The target has disadvantage on this saving throw if it communicated telepathically with you. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw each time it takes damage or if it starts its turn more than 1 mile away from you.</p>
