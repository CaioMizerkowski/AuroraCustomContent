Up to three times while the spell is active, as an action, you can breathe a 20-foot cone of poison gas, dealing 6d8 poison damage to each creature in the cone and making it poisoned until it finishes a long or short rest. A creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw takes half as much damage from your breath weapon and is not poisoned. Finally, you gain a climbing speed of 40 feet.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You create a 30-foot-radius area around a point that you choose within range. An intelligent creature that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature starts to engage in celebratory revelry: drinking, singing, laughing, and dancing. Affected creatures are reluctant to leave the area until the spell ends, preferring to continue the festivities. They forsake appointments, cease caring about their woes, and generally behave in a cordial (if not hedonistic) manner. This preoccupation with merrymaking occurs regardless of an affected creature’s agenda or alignment. Assassins procrastinate, servants join in the celebration rather than working, and guards abandon their posts. </p>
			<p class="indent">The effect ends on a creature when it is attacked, takes damage, or is forced to leave the area. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can enter or leave the area without danger of being enchanted. A creature that fails the saving throw and is forcibly removed from the area must repeat the saving throw if it returns to the area. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the spell lasts for an additional hour for each slot level above 7th. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ritual Focus.</i></b> If you expend your ritual focus, an unaffected intelligent creature must make a new saving throw every time it starts its turn in the area, even if it has previously succeeded on a save against the spell. Also, once you've expended your ritual focus this mental energy has been expended, a caster’s ritual focus can’t be used again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.</p>

		<supports>Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Make a melee spell attack against a creature that has a number of Hit Dice no greater than your level and has at least 1 hit point. On a hit, you conjure pulsating waves of chaotic energy within the creature and yourself. After a brief moment that seems to last forever, your hit point total changes, as does the creature’s. Roll a d100 and increase or decrease the number rolled by any number up to your spellcasting level, then find the result on the Hit Point Flux table. Apply that result both to yourself and the target creature. Any hit points gained beyond a creature’s normal maximum are temporary hit points that last for 1 round per caster level. </p>
			<p class="indent">For example, a 3rd-level spellcaster who currently has 17 of her maximum 30 hit points casts chaotic vitality on a creature with 54 hit points and rolls a 75 on the Hit Point Flux table. The two creatures have a combined total of 71 hit points. A result of 75 indicates that both creatures get 50 percent of the total, so the spellcaster and the target end up with 35 hit points each. In the spellcaster’s case, 5 of those hit points are temporary and will last for 3 rounds. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the maximum Hit Dice of the affected creature increases by 2 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

			<p>You summon the power of the earth dragon and shoot a ray at one target within 60 feet. The target falls prone and takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage from being slammed to the ground. If the target was flying or levitating, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet it falls. If the target makes a successful Strength saving throw, damage is halved, it doesn’t fall, and it isn’t knocked prone. </p>

Plant creatures are not affected by clearing the field.</p>

Also, once you've expended your ritual focus this mental energy has been expended, a caster’s ritual focus can’t be used again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.</p>

<!-- CONTROL ICE  -->
	<element name="Control Ice" type="Spell" source="Deep Magic" id="ID_KBP_DM5E_SPELL_CONTROL_ICE">
		<supports>Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Until the spell ends, you control any ice inside an area you choose within range that can be as large as a cube 100 feet on a side. You choose one of the following three effects when you cast this spell. As an action on each of your turns thereafter, you can use the same effect or choose a different one. Any alterations made to the ice remain after the spell ends, but can be altered by other effects (temperature, seismic action, or another application of this spell, for example). </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Crack</i></b>. You cause ice in the area to crack and splinter. On level terrain, this effect turns the ice into difficult terrain, possibly producing other hazards, depending on the terrain and the nature of the ice—ice over a deep chasm might open onto a pit, while ice over water can break into individual floes, for example. Using this effect on cliffs, walls, or ceilings made of ice can cause collapse, dealing 4d10 bludgeoning damage to creatures in the area below the collapse, or half the damage with a successful Dexterity saving throw. After such a collapse, the area where the fallen ice collects becomes difficult terrain. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Reshape.</i></b> You cause ice in a portion of the area to rapidly melt, move, and re-form into whatever shape you command. You can block holes, open tunnels, form bridges, remove difficult terrain, or otherwise alter the form of the ice in the area. You can cause ice to become slippery, making it difficult terrain, or dry to remove difficult terrain. You can fill a hole up to a 20-foot cube, or create 20 feet (up to 20 feet wide) of a bridge across a chasm, or raise a 20-foot-tall pillar of ice (up to 20 feet square). You can continue this action on consecutive rounds to increase the size of the affected area while you maintain concentration on the spell. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Thicken/Thin.</i></b> You cause existing ice to increase or decrease in thickness, up to 1 inch per round over some or all of the total area, either making the surface stronger or creating thin ice that is hazardous to walk on. </p>

			<p>You create a great, writhing mass of shadows that move slowly in a direction you choose. The grasping, shadowy tendrils occupy up to three 10-foot cubes within range. The mass has a speed of 20 feet, and it moves each round at the end of your turn, ignoring difficult terrain. The shadows can also move vertically or across a ceiling, as long as they can travel along a surface on which to cling. </p>
			<p class="indent">All light in this area is reduced to dim light. The surface covered by the darkness is considered difficult terrain. </p>
			<p class="indent">If the darkness moves into the space occupied by a living creature, that creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is restrained. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not restrained. Any creature in the area of the spell at the start of its turn must make another Constitution saving throw, taking damage in each round that it remains in the area. Restrained creatures move with the darkness, dragged along by the shadowy tendrils. A creature can take an action on its turn to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to free itself from the tendrils. </p>
			<p class="indent">Bright light can destroy portions of the spell. One 5-foot cube is destroyed if it takes 12 radiant damage. As long as at least one 5-foot cube occupies all or part of a creature’s space, the creature remains restrained.</p>

			<p>You designate a creature within range that you can see. If the target fails a Charisma saving throw, it and its equipment are frozen solid, becoming an inert statue of ice. The creature is effectively paralyzed, but mental activity does not cease, and signs of life are detectable; the creature still breathes and its heart continues to beat, though both acts are almost imperceptible. If the ice statue is broken or damaged while frozen, the creature will have matching damage or injury when returned to its original state. Dispel magic can’t end this spell, but it can allow the target to speak (but not move or cast spells) for a number of rounds equal to the spell slot used. Greater restoration or more potent magic is needed to free a creature from the ice.</p>
