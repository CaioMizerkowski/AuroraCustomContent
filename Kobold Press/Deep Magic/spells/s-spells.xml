<!-- SALT LASH  -->	
	<element name="Salt Lash" type="Spell" source="Deep Magic" id="ID_KBP_DM5E_SPELL_SALT_LASH">
		<supports>Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You create a long, thin blade of razor-sharp salt crystals. You can wield it as a longsword, using your spellcasting ability to modify your weapon attack rolls. The sword deals 2d8 slashing damage on a hit, and any creature struck by the blade must make a successful Constitution saving throw or be stunned by searing pain until the start of your next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to the blade’s secondary (stun) effect; plants and creatures composed mostly of water, such as water elementals, also take an additional 2d8 necrotic damage if they fail the saving throw. </p>
			<p class="indent">The spell lasts until you stop concentrating on it, the duration expires, or you let go of the blade for any reason.</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you cast this spell, you prick yourself with the material component, taking 1 piercing damage. The spell fails if this damage is prevented or negated in any way. From the drop of blood, you conjure a blood elemental (Creature Codex, p. 138). The blood elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. It disappears when it’s reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys verbal commands from you (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the blood elemental, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken, the blood elemental doesn’t disappear, but you lose control of it and it becomes hostile to you and your companions. An uncontrolled blood elemental cannot be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You summon death and decay to plague your enemies. For dragons, this act often takes the form of attacking a foe’s armor and scales, as a way of weakening an enemy dragon and leaving it plagued by self-doubt and fear. (This enchantment is useful against any armored creature, not just dragons.) </p>
			<p class="indent">One creature of your choice within range that has natural armor must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, attacks against that creature’s Armor Class are made with advantage, and the creature can’t regain hit points through any means while the spell remains in effect. An affected creature can end the spell by making a successful Constitution saving throw, which also makes the creature immune to further castings of scale rot for 24 hours. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the number of affected targets increases by one for each slot level above 4th.</p>

			<p>You foresee your foe’s strike a split second before it occurs. When you cast this spell successfully, you also designate a number of your allies that can see or hear you equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Those allies are also not surprised by the attack and can act normally in the first round of combat. </p>
			<p class="indent">If you would be surprised, you must make a check using your spellcasting ability at the moment your reaction would be triggered. The check DC is equal to the current initiative count. On a failed check, you are surprised and can’t use your reaction to cast this spell until after your next turn. On a successful check, you can use your reaction to cast this spell immediately.</p>

		<supports>Druid,Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>When you cast sculpt snow in an area filled with snow, you can create one Large object, two Medium objects, or four smaller objects from snow. With a casting time of 1 action, your sculptings bear only a crude resemblance to generic creatures or objects. If you increase the casting time to 1 minute, your creations take on a more realistic appearance and can even vaguely resemble specific creatures; the resemblance isn’t strong enough to fool anyone, but the creature can be recognized. The sculptures are as durable as a typical snowman. </p>
			<p class="indent">Sculptures created by this spell can be animated with animate objects or comparable magic. Animated sculptures gain the AC, hit points, and other attributes provided by that spell. When they attack, they deal normal damage plus a similar amount of cold damage; an animated Medium sculpture, for example, deals 2d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage plus 2d6 + 1 cold damage. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can sculpt one additional Large object for each slot level above 2nd. Two Large objects can be replaced with one Huge object.</p>

<!-- SEAL OF SANCTUARY --> 
	<element name="Seal of Sanctuary" type="Spell" source="Deep Magic" id="ID_KBP_DM5E_SPELL_SEAL_OF_SANCTUARY">
		<supports>Cleric,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You inscribe an angelic seal on the ground, the floor, or other solid surface of a structure. The seal creates a spherical sanctuary with a radius of 50 feet, centered on the seal. For the duration, aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead that approach to within 5 feet of the boundary know they are about to come into contact with a deadly barrier. If such a creature moves so as to touch the boundary, or tries to cross the boundary by any means, including teleportation and extradimensional travel, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10d8 radiant damage, is repelled to 5 feet outside the boundary, and can’t target anything inside the boundary with attacks, spells, or abilities until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much radiant damage and can cross the boundary. If the creature is a fiend that isn’t on its home plane, it is immediately destroyed (no saving throw) instead of taking damage. </p>
			<p class="indent">Aberrations, elementals, fey, and undead that are within 50 feet of the seal (inside the boundary) have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and each such creature takes 2d8 radiant damage at the start of its turn. </p>
			<p class="indent">Creatures other than aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t be charmed or frightened while within 50 feet of the seal. </p>
			<p class="indent">The seal has AC 18, 50 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Ranged attacks against the seal are made with disadvantage. If it is scribed on the surface of an object that is later destroyed (such as a wooden door), the seal is not damaged and remains in place, perhaps suspended in midair. The spell ends only if the seal is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This spell intensifies the light and heat of the sun, so that it burns exposed flesh. You must be able to see the sun when you cast the spell. The searing sunlight affects a cylindrical area 50 feet in radius and 200 feet high, centered on the a point within range. Each creature that starts its turn in that area takes 5d8 fire damage, or half the damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature that’s shaded by a solid object —such as an awning, a building, or an overhanging boulder— has advantage on the saving throw. On your turn, you can use an action to move the center of the cylinder up to 20 feet along the ground in any direction.</p>

			<p>If a creature you designate within range fails a Charisma saving throw, you cause the target’s shadow to come to life and reveal one of the creature’s most scandalous secrets: some fact that the target would not want widely known (GM’s choice). When casting the spell, you choose whether everyone present will hear the secret, in which case the shadow speaks loudly in a twisted version of the target’s voice, or if the secret is whispered only to you. The shadow speaks in the target’s native language. </p>
			<p class="indent">If the target does not have a scandalous secret or does not have a spoken language, the spell fails as if the creature’s saving throw had succeeded. </p>
			<p class="indent">If the secret was spoken aloud, the target takes a −2 penalty to Charisma checks involving anyone who was present when it was revealed. This penalty lasts until you finish a long rest. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ritual Focus.</i></b> If you expend your ritual focus, the target has disadvantage on Charisma checks instead of taking the −2 penalty.

			<p>You instill a hunger for the life force of others into a weapon you touch. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits dim light in a 30-foot radius. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage on a hit. If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 necrotic damage and you heal half that many hit points. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and you do not heal.</p>

		<supports>Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>This spell increases gravity tenfold in a 50-foot radius centered on you. Each creature in the area other than you drops whatever it’s holding, falls prone, becomes incapacitated, and can’t move. If a solid object (such as the ground) is encountered when a flying or levitating creature falls, the creature takes three times the normal falling damage. Any creature except you that enters the area or starts its turn there must make a successful Strength saving throw or fall prone and become incapacitated and unable to move. A creature that starts its turn prone and incapacitated makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, it takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage, it’s no longer incapacitated, and it can move at half speed. </p>
			<p class="indent">All ranged weapon attacks inside the area have a normal range of 5 feet and a maximum range of 10 feet. The same applies to spells that create missiles that have mass, such as flaming sphere. A creature under the influence of a freedom of movement spell or comparable magic has advantage on the Strength saving throws required by this spell, and its speed isn’t reduced once it recovers from being incapacitated. </p>

			<p>You summon a friendly star from the heavens to do your bidding. It appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range and takes the form of a glowing humanoid with long white hair. All creatures other than you who view the star must make a successful Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for the duration of the spell. A creature charmed in this way can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer charmed and is immune to the effect of this casting of the spell. In all other ways, the star is equivalent to a deva. It understands and obeys verbal commands you give it. If you do not give the star a command, it defends itself and attacks the last creature that attacked it. The star disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>

			<p>Using your strength of will, you cause one creature other than yourself that you touch to become so firmly entrenched within reality that it is protected from the effects of a chaos magic surge.

Once the protected creature makes a successful saving throw allowed by surge dampener, the spell ends. </p>
