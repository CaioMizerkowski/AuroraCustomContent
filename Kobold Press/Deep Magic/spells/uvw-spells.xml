		<description>
			<p>You create a channel to a region of the Plane of Shadow that is inimical to life and order. A storm of dark, raging entropy fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Any creature that starts its turn in the storm or enters it for the first time on its turn takes 6d8 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion; a successful Constitution saving throw halves the damage and prevents the exhaustion.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use a bonus action on your turn to move the area of the storm 30 feet in any direction.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You infuse your body with raw chaos and will it to adopt a helpful mutation. Roll a d10 and consult the Uncontrollable Transformation table below to determine what mutation occurs. You can try to control the shifting of your body to gain a mutation you prefer, but doing so is taxing; you can roll a d10 twice and choose the result you prefer, but you gain one level of exhaustion. At the end of the spell, your body returns to its normal form. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you gain an additional mutation for each slot level above 7th. You gain one level of exhaustion for each mutation you try to control.</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d10</td><td>Mutation</td></tr>

				<tr><td>1</td><td>A spindly third arm sprouts from your shoulder. As a bonus action, you can use it to attack with a light weapon. You have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and any checks that require the manipulation of tools. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Your skin is covered by rough scales that increase your AC by 1 and give you resistance to a random damage type (roll on the Damage Type table in the frenzied bolt spell description). </td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>A puckered orifice grows on your back. You can forcefully expel air from it, granting you a flying speed of 30 feet. You must land at the end of your turn. In addition, as a bonus action, you can try to push a creature away with a blast of air. The target is pushed 5 feet away from you if it fails a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>A second face appears on the back of your head. You gain darkvision out to a range of 120 feet and advantage on sight based and scent-based Wisdom (Perception) checks. You become adept at carrying on conversations with yourself. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>You grow gills that not only allow you to breathe underwater but also filter poison out of the air. You gain immunity to inhaled poisons. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Your hindquarters elongate, and you grow a second set of legs. Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet, and your carrying capacity becomes your Strength score multiplied by 20. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>You become incorporeal and can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. You can’t pick up or interact with physical objects that you weren’t carrying when you became incorporeal. </td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>Your limbs elongate and flatten into prehensile paddles. You gain a swimming speed equal to your base walking speed and have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim. In addition, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage. </td></tr>

		<supports>Bard,Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You animate an object in the possession of a creature within range, giving the object limited movement and a compulsion to thwart its possessor. The effect of the spell varies depending on the kind of object you affect. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Weapon:</i></b> A weapon being wielded by a creature fights and twists, trying to free itself from the creature’s grasp. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on any attacks it makes in that round with the weapon. On a save that fails by 5 or more, the creature drops the weapon. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Armor:</i></b> The creature’s armor shifts and moves, becoming noisy and uncomfortable. If the armor does not normally impart disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, it does so while this spell is in effect. The creature wearing it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take a 10-foot penalty to its speed and be unable to use the Dash action. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Other Items:</i></b> The effects on other carried items can vary at the GM’s discretion. A potion might behave as a weapon, trying not to be drunk, falling to the ground and becoming ruined if the Dexterity save is failed by 5 or more. A backpack might try to empty itself, disgorging a random item each round on a failed save.</p>

		<supports>Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You designate a creature within range that has the Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait and imbue it with wild magic, causing it to lose control of its magical ability. If the target gets a failure on a Charisma saving throw, then on its next turn, it rolls randomly to select one of its available spells. The target then spontaneously casts that spell as an action. If the spell can be cast using a spell slot higher than its level, roll randomly to determine what slot is used to cast the spell. The target still determines factors such as the location of the spell’s area or which creatures it affects, as normal, but it is compelled to cast that particular spell at that particular time. </p>
			<p class="indent">Each round while this spell remains in effect, the target makes another Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, it can act normally in that round, but the unshackled magic spell does not end.</p>

		<supports>Druid,Ranger,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You cause a vine to sprout from the ground and crawl across a surface or rise into the air in a direction chosen by you. The vine must sprout from a solid surface (such as the ground or a wall), and it is strong enough to support 600 pounds of weight along its entire length. The vine collapses immediately if that 600-pound limit is exceeded. A vine that collapses from weight or damage instantly disintegrates. </p>
			<p class="indent">The vine has many small shoots, so it can be climbed with a successful DC 5 Strength (Athletics) check. It has AC 8, hit points equal to 5 × your spellcasting level, and a damage threshold of 5. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the vine can support an additional 30 pounds, and its damage threshold increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ritual Focus.</i></b> If you expend your ritual focus, the vine is permanent until destroyed or dispelled. Also, once you've expended your ritual focus this mental energy has been expended, a caster’s ritual focus can’t be used again until he or she finishes a short or long rest.</p>

		<supports>Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You mark an unattended magic item (including weapons and armor) with a clearly visible stain of your blood. The exact appearance of the bloodstain is up to you. The item’s magical abilities don’t function for anyone else as long as the bloodstain remains on it. For example, a +1 flaming longsword with a vital mark functions as a nonmagical longsword in the hands of anyone but the caster, but it still functions as a +1 flaming longsword for the caster who placed the bloodstain on it. A wand of magic missiles would be no more than a stick in the hands of anyone but the caster. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher on the same item for 28 consecutive days, the effect becomes permanent until dispelled.</p>

You can make a straight wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a cylindrical wall up to 20 feet high, 1 foot thick, and 20 feet in diameter. Nonmagical ranged attacks that cross the wall vanish into the time stream with no other effect. Ranged spell attacks and ranged weapon attacks made with magic weapons that pass through the wall are made with disadvantage. A creature that intentionally enters or passes through the wall is affected as if it had just failed its initial saving throw against a slow spell.</p>

		<supports>Bard,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You surround yourself with the forces of chaos. Wild lights and strange sounds engulf you, making stealth impossible. While wild shield is active, you can use a reaction to repel a spell of 4th level or lower that targets you or whose area you are within. A repelled spell has no effect on you, but doing this causes the chance of a chaos magic surge as if you had cast a spell, with you considered the caster for any effect of the surge. </p>
			<p class="indent">Wild shield ends when the duration expires or when it absorbs 4 levels of spells. If you try to repel a spell whose level exceeds the number of levels remaining, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level – the number of levels wild shield can still repel. If the check succeeds, the spell is repelled; if the check fails, the spell has its full effect. The chance of a chaos magic surge exists regardless of whether the spell is repelled. </p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can repel one additional spell level for each slot level above 4th.</p>

		<supports>Sorcerer,Wizard</supports>
		<description>
			<p>You create a 30-foot cube of magical instability that causes spell effects passing through it to diverge wildly from their original paths. When a spell with a visible or tangible manifestation (such as fireball, lightning bolt, or a ray or projectile such as magic missile or ray of frost) passes through the area, roll a d8. On a 1, the spell continues on its original path or toward its original target; on a 2, it diverts 45 degrees to the right; on a 3, it diverts 90 degrees to the right; on a 4, it diverts 135 degrees to the right; on a 5, it turns 180 degrees, back the way it came (striking the caster if it is a targeted spell); on a 6, the spell diverts 45 degrees to the left; on a 7, it diverts 90 degrees to the left; on an 8, it diverts 135 degrees to the left. </p>
			<p class="indent">A spell that affects anything in its path, such as lightning bolt, continues to do so along its new trajectory, up to the limit of its range. A fireball spell will travel in the new direction up to the limit of its range before detonating. A targeted spell will strike the first viable target it encounters along its new trajectory.</p>

Each creature in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of its turn must make a successful Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and gain one level of exhaustion.

			<p>Upon casting wintry glide, you can travel via ice or snow without crossing the intervening space. If you are adjacent to a mass of ice or snow, you can enter it by expending 5 feet of movement. By expending another 5 feet of movement, you can immediately exit from that mass at any point—within 500 feet—that’s part of the contiguous mass of ice or snow.
