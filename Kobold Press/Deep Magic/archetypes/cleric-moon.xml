MOON’S GRACE 
When you select this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Perception and Stealth, and you don’t have disadvantage on Stealth checks when you wear medium armor. 
CHANNEL DIVINITY: NIGHT’S CHILL 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness moonlight, which banishes magical light and deals cold damage to your foes. When you present your holy symbol as an action and use your Channel Divinity, any magical light within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes cold damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level, or half as much damage with a successful Constitution saving throw. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected. 
LUMINESCENT AURA 
At 6th level, you can emit a nimbus of light in a 30-foot radius for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. This effect acts as a light spell but provides only dim light. All weapons and ammunition are treated as silvered while they’re in the aura and for 1 round after leaving it. Opponents that end their turn in the aura must make a successful Dexterity saving throw or be limned in silver light, identical in effect to a faerie fire spell, until the end of their next turn. 
You can use this feature three times, and you regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. 
DIVINE STRIKE 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
THE MOONLIT WAY 
Beginning at 17th level, whenever the moon is visible in the sky, you can use an action to detect magical pathways, portals, and gate effects. To be detected, a portal must be within your line of sight and no farther than 120 feet from you. Detected portals are visible only to you, but you can point out their locations to others. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. -->
