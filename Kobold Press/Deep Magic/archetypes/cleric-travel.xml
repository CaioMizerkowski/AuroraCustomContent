TRAVEL DOMAIN 
Voyages across oceans, over mountain ranges, through steaming jungles, and from one world to the next all have an aspect of the sacred to them. The wisdom, knowledge, and prosperity gained through furthering one’s experience of the world also venerates the gods who made such places and those who watch over such journeys. An agent of one of these deities might be in some demand as a charm to help ensure safe travel, though the wise know that the gods often consider an easy journey to be less beneficial to the traveler’s spirit.
