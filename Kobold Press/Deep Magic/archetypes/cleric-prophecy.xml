PROPHECY DOMAIN 
You see the future, whether for good or ill. Eventually, you might become an oracle renowned across the region. 
PROPHECY DOMAIN SPELLS 
CLERIC LEVEL 	SPELLS 
1st 	divine favor, insightful maneuver*

* Described in this book 

A PATH FORETOLD 
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in History and Insight. You also learn one exotic language of your choice, subject to GM approval. 
CHANNEL DIVINITY: ONE MOVE AHEAD 
Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to add 20 feet to your walking speed for a number of rounds equal to your cleric level. 
CHANNEL DIVINITY: FUTURE SIGHT 
At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to declare that an action or movement you just performed did not happen, allowing you to take a different action or make a different movement. You can do this after the result of your activity is known, so long as it didn’t result in your unconsciousness or death. Only a single action or movement can be nullified. The mixing of future and present is disorienting, so you gain one level of exhaustion after using this ability. 
DIVINE STRIKE 
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. 
IT WAS FORETOLD 
At 17th level, you gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws, Wisdom (Perception) checks, and Wisdom (Insight) checks. You also gain resistance to fire, poison, and psychic damage. 
With the GM’s consent, you can issue a prophecy from your deity once per month. You might become a renowned (and controversial) prophet, attracting both loyal followers and terrible enemies. Consult with your GM to find out what news, if any, your deity wants foretold.
